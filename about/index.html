<p>I&rsquo;m a highly motivated and passionate Data Scientist whose dream is to use my talents in machine learning/AI and deep learning to solve real-world problems and make the customer achieve more..</p>
<p>Ever since I was little kid, software and gaming development has been my passion. I learned C, then C++, tearing through any books I could find on anything remotely related to software development. Later I get to know about machine learning where we can explicitly train computer to do the task without using any conditional statements. I was amazed by this technology and I knew that I have to do my major in this. I have learned mathematics behind every popular model and algorithms which gave me a good grip and deep intuition in deep learning. I learned python because it was really easy to learn and very powerful to manipulate data and train some really complex models. Apart from coding I play video games a lot especially counter strike, this urge of understanding machine learning started from this game, where I wanted to create such bots that can not be defeated by a human. I am still learning Reinforcement Learning to complete this task. I want to understand things clearly and want to explain it to others fluently. So, now, this passion remains with me. There&rsquo;s certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this, I am very grateful.</p>
